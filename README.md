# üëã Hi there! I'm Dmytro

I‚Äôm a frontend-leaning fullstack developer based in Germany, with a passion for turning ideas into production-ready software. I care about clean code, practical UX, and building things that actually get used.

I recently completed my fullstack training at DCI (Digital Career Institute), where I focused on React, Node.js, and MongoDB by building real products from scratch ‚Äî not just tutorials. My biggest project so far is BookBook, a complete book-swapping platform with map-based browsing, real-time chat, and swap logic. I even self-host it on my Raspberry Pi to manage deployment end-to-end.

### üíª What I work with
- Frontend: React, SCSS, responsive & accessible design, animations, form validation, map integrations
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, REST APIs, cron jobs, real-time messaging with Socket.io
- DevOps / Hosting: Raspberry Pi server hosting (prod & demo builds), Tailscale, secure Samba, CI-friendly project structure
- Version Control & Workflow: Git branching, soft resets/reverts, clean commit history, Postman for API testing

### üöÄ Current Focus
- Expanding BookBook with new features & refinements
- Improving TypeScript and automated testing skills
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Preparing for a Junior Frontend / Fullstack Developer role in a collaborative, product-driven team
